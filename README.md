# Oxidized Transformers

Oxidized Transformers is a Rust transformers library that starts out as
a port of [Curated Transformers](https://github.com/explosion/curated-transformers/tree/main).
We are still laying the foundations, so Oxidezed Transformers is **not yet
usable**. Keep an eye on the repo, since progress is currently fast.
